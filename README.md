# Stream-Function
#### Determining Streamlines and Velocity Vectors by Solving the Laplace's Equation for the Stream Function Using Fortran

An incompressible ideal fluid flows steadily between the inlet and outlet of a reservoir.

The Laplace's equation for the stream function is solved using the finite difference method.
